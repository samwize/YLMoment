 * The range was modified to suit a common range of less than 7 days.

 * Used by: Poo Keeper
 *
 * For 25 to 7*24 hours, the format is "d1/dd h1/hh", which is concatenating the days and hours
 * components. The order might not be correctly represented in a localized language.
 *
 * d1 and h1 was introduced too to mean "1 day" instead of "a day"
